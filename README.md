# URLShortener
For this project, I had to employ an almost entirely new work flow. All of my previous work with databases and cloud deploymeny had been through my windows desktop at home and through a windows laptop that I had recieved for my internship, so I had to adjust to all the differences between mac and windows computers. I started by downloading mySql and creating a database where my data was going to be stored for this project. I created an outline of the different components that a URL and a user would have and then established the relationship between the two. I then created the service side of the web service accessing my local database,set up the entity framework core through a code first migration, and used postman to ensure that a client side approach would recieve the same data. After the service side was developed, I created the UI portion of the project. I coded so that the two would work synergistically, and developed the MVC project for the url shortener. Finally, after I was finished developing using my local database and the local instance of my service applicatoin as the target for my web application, I then deployed my database and web service to the cloud using Azure devops.
